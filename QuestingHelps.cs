|		    For common scripting events as part of questing profile behaviors.
| NOTE: 	"ExecuteLua" API function executes "LUA" code language inserted into the C#
| NOTE: 	ALSO!!! This not a more standardized API with setters and getters, which ultimately would be nice,
| NOTE:		but I am writing more focused script functions specifically for questing, so 
| NOTE:		please understand if this is lacking common programming practices :D
