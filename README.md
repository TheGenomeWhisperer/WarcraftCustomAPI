WarcraftQuestingHelpsCustomAPI

Author: TheGenomeWhisperer.

This is essentially writing several custom methods to be used as I write Scripting profiles for Warcraft Questing in
reference to the Rebot program.  More information on this program can be found on Rebot.to, but I write these scripts fully
and solely as a side interest and excercise based upon my personal nature to get something done right.

In other words, there are other pre-existing projects within this realm, but none seem to be up to the quality I am satisfied with, so I had the option of being content with that, or to take upon myself a fun side project to MAKE such a thing
as to be up to the standards that I could put my name on, and also recommend freely to others to use.

I am satisfied with the ongoing progress so far.
