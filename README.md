The QH Class refers to "QuestingHelps" in regards to building a more complete API.  The purpose of its completion is to assist in expanding the avaliable toolset given by the official [Rebot API](http://www.rebot.to/showthread.php?t=1899) so as to have a more efficient process of building questing profiles, scripts, and templates to make a 100% hands-free and efficient questing process for the player.
