WarcraftQuestingHelpsCustomAPI
=======

Author: TheGenomeWhisperer. (aka Sklug)

This is essentially writing several custom methods to be used as I write Scripting profiles for Warcraft Questing in
reference to the Rebot program.  More information on this program can be found on Rebot.to, but I write these scripts fully
and solely as a side interest and excercise based upon my personal nature to get something done right.

UPDATE 4/22/15
Managed to Push out Zones up through Talador/Scrapyard sidequest chain, so far.  Next Goal is to finish Spires and then Nagrand.

UPDATE 5/4/15
Created this to be a ChangeLog rather than a "README"
Added several new Methods:
  DoGossipOnMatch()
  ScenarioStageEquals()
  MiniMapZoneEquals()
  GTownHallExit()
  UnequipWeapon()
  EquipWeapon()
